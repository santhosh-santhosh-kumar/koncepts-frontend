However, a key distinction lies in the fact that mobile apps are often designed to leverage the unique features and capabilities of specific mobile devices.</p>
                        <p className="font-ContentText text-[15px] md:text-[19px] mb-0 py-3 text-slate-600 text-justify">The development of mobile applications varies significantly based on the device type and platform, with different environments, programming languages, and processes involved. As a result, apps often need to be created individually for each platform. This fragmentation leads to limited code reusability due to the diverse programming interfaces (APIs) across different systems..</p>
